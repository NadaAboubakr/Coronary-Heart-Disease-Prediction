# Predicting the Ten-Year Risk of Developing Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
This project involves predicting the ten-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) using machine learning models. The dataset used is the Framingham Heart Study dataset, and the model is built using Python libraries. The final prediction model is built and evaluated in Jupyter notebooks with visualizations and proper data preprocessing.
